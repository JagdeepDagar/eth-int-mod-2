Hardhat Project
This is the second module of ETH: Intermediate 
This project demonstrates the deployment of a simple smart contract using Hardhat. The smart contract stores a string and a uint value, which can be retrieved using public functions.
The smart contract is written in Solidity.
The deployment script, deploy.js, is used to deploy the contract to the blockchain.
Compile the contract using Hardhat.
You can interact with the deployed contract using Hardhat's console or writing additional scripts. To retrieve the stored values, use the getMessage and getNumber functions.
